# Mapmaker Mapmaker

### Introduction

Mapping - it's string-building for arrays!

Kind of like "Tinder for ____", but... less [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)).


### Workflow

This is your typical test-run assignment. `jest --watch-all` is your friend!


### Guidelines

* Now that we're not dealing with strings as our main focus--we'll be using strings, but focusing overall on the arrays that hold them--, let's open things up to using string methods. You should find `.slice` and `.indexOf` (the string version, not the array version) particularly useful. A little research is your friend on this!
* Also useful: `Math.abs`, which takes in a number and gives you back its absolute value. Check it out!
* **But do not use ANY array methods.** Particularly `.map`-- that' the one we're doing manually here, after all!
